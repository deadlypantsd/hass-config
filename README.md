# Home Assistant Configuration

I have chosen not to include my Lovelace Dashboard configurations as it would take _WAY_ too much effort to redact all of my entities and edit it all for GitHub. However, I will point you to Mattias Persson's repositories;the basis [https://github.com/matt8707] of which this configuration was created. 

### Custom Integraions:
 - HACS

### You will need to install the following cards, at a minimum, from HACS. Add them to `ui/resources.yaml` manually:
- button-card
- custom-icons
- layout-card
- more-info-card
- mushroom
- slider-entity-row
- auto-entities
- stack-in-card
- multiple-entity-row
- bar-card
- apexcharts-card
